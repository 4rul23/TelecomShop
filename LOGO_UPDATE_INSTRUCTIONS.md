## ‚úÖ Changes Made

I've updated your application to use the new logo in the following locations:

### 1. Navigation Header
- Added logo alongside "TelecomShop" text in the navigation bar
- Logo appears as a 32x32px icon next to the brand name

### 2. About Page
- Main company logo display updated to use new logo
- Logo appears in a circular container (128x128px)

### 3. Home Page Hero Section
- Hero section main image updated to use new logo
- Large display (400x400px) for prominent branding

### 4. Product Images
- Updated fallback images for product cards and detail pages
- Now uses `/placeholder-product.svg` instead of company logo for product placeholders

## üîß Manual Steps Required

### Step 1: Save the New Logo
You need to manually save your new logo image as:
```
/public/telecom-shop-logo.png
```

### Step 2: File Format Recommendations
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (recommended)
- **Size**: At least 400x400px for best quality
- **Optimization**: Compress the file for web use

### Step 3: Test the Updates
After saving the logo file:
1. Restart your development server
2. Check these pages:
   - Home page (`/`) - Hero section
   - About page (`/about`) - Main logo display
